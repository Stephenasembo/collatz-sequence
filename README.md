# collatz-sequence

## Introduction
The collatz sequence is a sequence of a number which ends with the number one. Implementing the collatz sequence is part of my learning journey in python whereby I learn how to utilize functions, recursion and error handling.

## Features
- **Collatz Function**: Generates and prints the collatz sequence from a starting number.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure the user inputs a valid integer.
